The Food Booth is a recipe generator app created with the purpose of practicing Reacts useContext hook, dynamic routing and API data fetching. 
The idea of the app is to display a landing page where a user can login (users are hard coded in a database, only user name is required to log in).
If the user doesn't log in they can only view the Guest Home Page which generates one random recipe. 
If the user logs in they are presented with a few randomly generated recipes on the home page, they can access more recipes throgh the categories, see the full recipe and description when they click on a recipe. The user can also save their favourite recipes and access them from their profile page.
